# Advent of Code 2021 - Code Roulette

This year i have chosen 13 languages and put them all into a hat. Each day, im picking a language out of said hat (its actually a box) and trying to complete the challenge in it.

The language are as follows:

* c
* c++
* c#
* clojure
* erlang
* gdscript
* go
* haskell
* java
* javascript
* lua
* python
* scheme

I'm also making a youtube video series of my progress, check it out here: [Advent of Code - Code Roulette Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5qJSX28k30&list=PLkD0xuVmwo66rb2HeN561x_mcg9fvSXIC&ab_channel=BOCDev)
